# EspEasy-RC-Switch
RC-Switch plugins for use with ESPEasy (see: https://www.letscontrolit.com/forum/viewtopic.php?f=6&t=2475)

Paste the scripts in your build environment and build it. 

Do not forget to include the RC-switch library, and include the IR plugins for now (_P016_IR.ino / _P035_IRTX.ino). 

If you encounter memory limits/ errors, remove some of the standard ESP Easy plugins to free some memory!
